# Clinostat3D-Arduino
This code was produced using two board, one Esp32 board and one Arduino, so you need to use both to work this project, in this GitHub you should found the Arduino code part. I recommend to use the IDE PlatformIO to use this code, because was what I used to code this code, but if you want to use the Arduino IDE it is okay too. <br>
All the code produced in C++ is found in the src folder.<br>
If you want the see the Arduino part click here: [Clinostat3D-Esp32](https://github.com/carloterzaghi/Clinostat3D-Esp32)

# How to install
1. First you need to have PlatformIO install in your IDE, I recommend using VSCode in this case
2. Open this folder with PlatformIO
3. Connect your Arduino Uno on the computer
4. Use the "PlatformIO: Upload" to upload the src code with the C++ code
